# Kirchhoff Solver

Simple commandline-based electronic circuit simulator written in C. Takes as input the circuit specifications represented in the SPICE netlist format.


## TODO:
- Write and test an DFS-based algorithm to extract all *independent* closed loops from the circuit. 
- Integrate it into the codebase.
